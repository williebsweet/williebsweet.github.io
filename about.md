[I'm Will Sweet, the co-founder and CEO of Shef](http://www.shef.io "Shef")[ an app that optimizes recipe ingredients for minimal waste - saving home cooks time and money.]

[I previously worked at Houlihan Lokey as a financial analyst and co-founded FlameTech, a patent-pending safety and convenience system for gas grills. In 2015, FlameTech won Georgia Tech's annual InVenture Prize, affectionately nicknamed "American Idol for Nerds."]

[As part of my work with Shef, and in part due to a personal facination, I think and sometimes write on the subjects of Aggregation Theory, Disruptive Innovation, Behavioral Economics, and "Last Mile Problems." The latter being a subject that analyzes the innovations of technology, business, and behavior needed to catalyze future innovations.]

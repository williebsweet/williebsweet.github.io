I'm Will Sweet, the co-founder and CEO of [Shef][Shef], an app that optimizes recipe ingredients for minimal waste - saving home cooks time and money.

I previously worked at Houlihan Lokey as a financial analyst and co-founded FlameTech, a patent-pending safety and convenience system for gas grills. In 2015, FlameTech won Georgia Tech's  InVenture Prize, affectionately nicknamed "American Idol for Nerds."

As part of my work with Shef, and in part due to a personal fascination, I think and sometimes write on the subjects of Aggregation Theory, Disruptive Innovation, Behavioral Economics, and "Last Mile Problems." The latter being a subject that analyzes the innovations of technology, business, and behavior needed to catalyze future innovations.

While the underlying technologies are much the same, the difference between Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Intelligence can be seen in their application and scope of ambition.

**Artificial Intelligence** (AI) is designed to *​replace* hum​an actions[^1] by mimicking current human activity, leveraging computational efficiency to outpace human performance. These technologies can range from the commercially prevalent but limited, such as image recognition, to the bleeding-edge[^2], such as game-playing AIs. Regardless of implementation, the goal is always to replace the human element of the equation.

By contrast, **Augmented Intelligence** is designed to *​complement* human behaviors by addressing a behavioral gap in human activity, leveraging computational efficiency to expand human capacity. These technologies fill a void, or what I refer to in the previous sentence as a behavioral gap[^3], created by people not taking ideal actions or not making optimal choices due to the oft-overwhelming cognitive load required.

It may seem like pulling hairs and the lines do blur with particular implementations, but delineating between the two subjects creates a stronger framework for evaluating technologies and their applications.

[^1]: Perhaps more appropriately, decision based actions.
[^2]: A number of which lack commercial viability.
[^3]: Often, these gaps are signaled by a mix of quantitative and qualitative measures that are several degrees removed from the gap. A good example of a quantitative signal is the 40% of food wasted in the U.S. When investigating the sources of this waste, it becomes evident that two major contributing factors are household ingredient waste and prepared food waste. Most cooks don't take these factors into account when planning and preparing a meal, primarily because the amount of thought needed before each meal would be overwhelming.

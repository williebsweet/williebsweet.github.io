        <p>How to Listen to Advice - understand the framework from which the advisor speaks (why are they saying what they are saying) and then reframe it to apply to you</p>

<p>Goal Oriented Thinking - what is the goal? (if you can figure out the goal you can predict motivations or if you the world operates irrationally there is an opportunity to help align actions and goals, even the actions and goals of others - i.e. customers or businesses). Figure out the goal and then work backwards to find the actions needed to reach that goal - there is your roadmap.</p>

<p>Thinking About Markets in Terms of Friction Points - where are the friction points and value spots of a market</p>

<p>Thinking in Degrees of Separation -</p>

<p>Customer Acquisition Costs vs. Long Term Value - target customers play a hug role in this (upside-down triangle)</p>

<p>180 Degree Planning - solving a problem? there are numerous solutions that could be created. your goal is to find the one that maximizes your companies chances of success. think about yourself as a dot on a 180 degree line (that is the present). Each degree along that line represents a possible solution. Map out the current landscape of all the various options you have (these are the things you want to test) and once you hit on a solution that helps you narrow down to a smaller sliver, you continuously iterate over this process until you have a product</p>

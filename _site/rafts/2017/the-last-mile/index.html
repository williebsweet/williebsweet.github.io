        <h1>The Last Mile</h1>

    <section id="post-body">
        <p>The term “Last Mile” has been used to describe the final leg of product supply chains and telecommunications networks that deliver products or services to consumers. In both instances, the ultimate beneficiaries aren’t able to realize the value of what is being delivered until the gap between users and suppliers is filled. It is a distribution problem. And one that is often the bottleneck of both supply chains and networks.<center><b>⋅ ⋅ ⋅</b></center></p>

<p>But the “Last Mile” and its problems aren’t limited to the topics or thinking presented above. I define the “Last Mile” as the innovations of technology, business, and behavior needed to catalyze future innovations and customer adoption.</p>

<p>Not only does that definition encompass the previous uses of the term, but it also enables a framework for looking at problems throughout the rest of the value chain. This framework can also be applied to the creation of products, not just their distribution.</p>

<p>Take the first metal tools, for example<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Making them required metal, initially copper, and a stone tool for forming. Since metals like copper are naturally occurring and stone tools had been around long before metal ones, the last mile problem was forming that metal into something useful. Even if copper had been discovered at the dawn of man, it wouldn’t have been as useful until the stone tool came along to form it. Therefore, stone tools can be seen as the last mile catalyst of metal tools - it was necessary that they come first.</p>

<p>That’s a crude example of the subject, but provides insight into the new Last Mile framework. It’s not only a question of <em>distribution</em>, but also one of <em>foundation</em>. What comes after is the result of something that came before<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. Be it a technological breakthrough, new way of doing business, or shift in consumer sentiment.</p>

<p>This blog will serve as a record of my thoughts as I research and expound upon the different themes of the Last Mile. My goal is to explore the innovations of past and present, identify the last mile of the process, study the problems that had to be overcome, chronicle the solutions to those problems, and develop a system to identify the various routes to innovations of tomorrow.</p>

      <p>This is a rough example of the concept, but it shows how the new Last Mile framework is not only applicable to various parts of the value chain, but also not limited to era of supply chains and telecom networks.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>On some level this may seem to contradict Perter Thiel’s <strong><em>Zero to One</em></strong>. However, in the first chapter, Thiel acknowledges, “No one can predict the future exactly, but we know two things: it’s going to be different, and it must be rooted in today’s world.” Additionally, if you take one of his first examples of going from 0 to 1, going from typewriter to word processor, you can see the roots of the innovation in the pre-word processor world. Even simplifying the concept, a word processor requires a computer and coding language upon which the software is built (both necessary precursors need as a foundation). Instead, the Last Mile framework coexists with 0 to 1 logic, because even revolutionary innovations are built with components rooted in today’s world.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

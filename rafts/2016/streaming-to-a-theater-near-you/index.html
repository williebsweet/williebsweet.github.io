<p>I recently read Fortune’s <a href="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/theater.jpeg" title="Theater">“How to Make a Profit in the New Hollywood,”</a> which interestingly explored several trends in the movie industry, including the entrance of streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon into the world of original feature film content.<center><b>⋅ ⋅ ⋅</b></center></p>

<p>Netflix and Amazon are no strangers to original content. Their ballooning subscriber numbers and collective Emmy and Golden Globe nomination tallies over the last several years can attest to that fact. But up to this point, their expertise has been in the realm of television — an industry structured vastly different from that of feature films, especially in terms of distribution.</p>

<p>Keeping this in mind, one statement in the Fortune article really stuck out to me. In the closing paragraph of the piece, Fortune mentions that “simultaneous theater and home release has long been a no-no in Hollywood, with theater chains denouncing it and studios fearing it will cannibalize revenue,” adding that, “neither Netflix nor Amazon has figured out how to make the new economics work.”</p>

<p>To put this in perspective, Netflix’s first attempt to crack the feature film distribution model was to simultaneously release its first film, Beasts of No Nation, both online and in theaters. Ultimately, the film showed in 31 theaters and brought in less $91,000 in ticket sales — enough to make it eligible for Oscar nominations (though it didn’t get any) but not enough to make it a very compelling business model moving forward.</p>

<p>I’m not saying that I know all of Netflix’s motivations behind employing this strategy, but I believe that there is a better way to structure a theater distribution model for streaming services moving forward. One that could benefit both the streaming services (through exposure to new subscribers and awards) and the theaters (through less burdened revenue generation).</p>

<p>The solution: <em>give theaters the content for free</em>.</p>

<p>This is a radically different approach from the way movies are currently distributed. In the traditional studio distribution model, studios work with distributors to lease their movies to theaters in order to recoup the cost of the film’s production. But streaming services don’t have to follow this model because they cover production costs through subscription fees — freeing them up to pursue a new approach.</p>

<p>Ticket sales would then take place one of two ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Current streaming subscribers could claim free tickets to see the film in theaters — the only limit to the number of tickets the subscriber could claim would be the number of screens his or her subscription allows.</li>
  <li>Non-subscribers as well as anyone else could purchase tickets in the traditional sense — that ticket revenue would be split at a pre-negotiated rate between the streaming service and the theater. It’s worth noting that tickets for these films could have the potential to be sold for less than the average ticket price of studio movies, since the money would not have to cover any production costs and would automatically be profit for the streaming services.</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s not just the mechanics of the model that work, but it also acts as a value add for both parties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Theaters will still be able to benefit from the one thing that has kept movie theaters in business throughout years of declining ticket sales — concessions. In the traditional studio model where the distributor leases the film to the theater, tickets are often sold at a loss in order to get people in the door so that theaters can convert that traffic into profit through high margin concession sales. In the proposed model, a free movie or reduced ticket price would get more people in the door and allow the theaters to convert on concession sales without having to take the customary losses on ticket sales (and even giving them a cut of the revenue for non-subscriber ticket sales).</li>
  <li>On the streaming service side, theaters would be more likely to show the film (since the content would be a free way to get people in the door and ticket sales to non-subscribers would generate revenue not previously seen in the studio model) giving both the film and the streaming service’s ability to create original content more exposure to a wider audience. Looking past the additional revenue from non-subscriber ticket sales, the exposure could lead to more full-time subscribers or even that elusive Academy Award.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll admit, there are several core assumptions to this model that, if proven false, cause the entire model to collapse on itself. The biggest assumption of all: <em>people love going to the movies</em>. I’m writing this from my perspective and I personally love the experience of going to a theater. But unlike the people who are keeping theaters in business by buying a $10 bag of popcorn once they’ve already bought their ticket, I have a hard time shelling out money for concessions when I just paid $13-$18 just to get myself in the door. Change that equation around to where I am getting in the door for free, and that $13-$18 that I just saved might not stay in my pocket for long.</p>

<p>Additionally, it would strike a nice balance between dropping $30+ on a movie night out and doing a yet another movie night in. Who knows, maybe I could finally spring for those sour patch kids that I always see her eyeing.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: I have simplified several areas of the film distribution model for illustrative purposes. Each lease agreement between the theater and the distributor is unique and is likely to have different terms that have varying effect on the financial impact in each unique situation.</em></p>

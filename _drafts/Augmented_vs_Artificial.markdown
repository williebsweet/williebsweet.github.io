While the underlying technologies are much the same, the difference between Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Intelligence can be seen in their application and scope of ambition.

**Artificial Intelligence** (AI) is designed to *​replace* hum​an actions by mimicking current human activity and leveraging the computational efficiencies provided by computers to outpace human performance. These technologies can range from the commercially prevalent but limited, such as image recognition, to the bleeding-edge[^1], such as game-playing AIs. Regardless of implementation, the goal is always to replace the human element of the equation.

By contrast, **Augmented Intelligence** is designed to *​complement* human behaviors by addressing a behavioral gap in human activity and leveraging the computational efficiencies provided by computers to expand their capacity. These technologies often fill a void, or what I refer to in the previous sentence as a behavioral gap[^2], created by people not taking ideal actions or not making optimal choices due to the cognitive load required.

It may seem like pulling hairs and the lines do blur with particular implementations, but delineating between the two subjects creates a stronger framework for evaluating technologies and their applications.

[^1]: A number of which lack commercial viability.
[^2]: Often, these gaps are signaled by a mix of quantitative and qualitative measures that are several degrees removed from the gap. A good example of a quantitative signal is the 40% food waste in the U.S. When investigating the sources of this waste, it becomes evident that a major contributing factor is household ingredient waste and prepared food waste. Most cooks don't take these things into account when preparing a meal, primarily because the amount of thought needed before each meal would be too much.

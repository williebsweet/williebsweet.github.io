If you could find the motivations behind every potential customer for your business, I assume that your return-on-investment figures would increase dramatically.

Two kinds of currency exist: *Time* and *Money*[^1]. Regardless of the currency being spent, the end result is the same: the capture, experience, preservation, avoidance, or enjoyment of a moment.

To really grasp this, I feel like I need to explain the concept of time as both a currency and what is ultimately being bought (the definition of *moment*, after all, is "a very brief period of time"). Time is a finite resource that derives its value from its scarcity as well as the system in which it is converted to money, this is also the way it is able to become a currency.

To explain this in more detail I'll show that, regardless of whether it is a business or consumer doing the spending, time and money always flow to moments


Money, whose availability is determined by the issuing government, is a representation of value for a previous good or service, sold or performed.

[^1]: Bartering and other trades for goods or services of equal value are included in the use of the term "Money". The reason: at its core the current paper money system is just an evolution of the barter system of days past where the paper money represents a common standard of value set by the governing body.

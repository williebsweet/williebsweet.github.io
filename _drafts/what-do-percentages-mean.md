When speaking in terms of percentages, there are only two numbers that contain universal meaning: 0% and 100%.

Even in sports, percentages can get muddled. Don't believe me? Watch a baseball game and listen to the announcers talk about a hitter's batting average against a left handed pitcher on a slightly cloudy day with perfect 72% humidity with the wind blowing in a NNE direction[^1]. What does that even mean and how is it relevant?

In business, these two numbers mean that a task has either not been started or has been finished.

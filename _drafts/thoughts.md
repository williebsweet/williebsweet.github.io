It seems like so many projects are using the newest advances in AI, ML, and NLP[^1] to try and replicate many of the tasks that humans already do so well. And while I believe this to be an admirable pursuit, in the sense that it pushes these technologies to their limits, I also believe it to be a misguided use of resources.

It just so happens that the things that humans are good at are incredibly complex, immeasurably so when many human behaviors and actions are woven together (the reason why Artificial General Intelligence has thus far proven illusive).

That is I am much more bullish on the commercialization of technologies that do things that humans are innately poor at but machines are not. Unlike the frontier expanding advances that seek to replace the human part of the equation, most of these technologies augment humans in some capacity rather than supplant them.

Drafts are posts without a date. They’re posts you’re still working on and don’t want to publish yet. To get up and running with drafts, check the _drafts folder in the site’s root.

To preview your site with drafts, simply run **`jekyll serve`** or **`jekyll build`** with the **`--drafts`** switch. Each will be assigned the value modification time of the draft file for its date, and thus you will see currently edited drafts as the latest posts.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll's GitHub repo][jekyll-gh].

cd directory/directory/file
git status
git add .
git commit -m "commit message here"
git push

git serve #view on localhost
git serve --drafts #view drafts on localhost

Starting a company is hard.

Below are my 5 core beliefs regarding ideation:

> 1. Insight has to come from a genuine problem that you experience.
> 2. You have to be passionate about the problem, not the solution.
> 3. Your solution should take a different/contrarian approach.
> 4. A little naïveté never hurt anyone.
> 5. Always be learning.

I will be diving deeper into each of these over the next couple of weeks.

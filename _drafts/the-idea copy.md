*tl;dr* - The best ideas come from your own genuine problems. If that idea is contrarian to the way the world currently works, then you are more than likely on to something.

Sometimes prevailing wisdom seems to dictate that the success or failure of a startup is defined at the outset, with the initial idea.

<center>This gives the concept of the idea an almost mythical status.</center>

Unsurprisingly, this has an adverse impact on many potential founders. And I have seen it lead to two main approaches to ideation:

>1. _The Shotgun Approach_ - throw as many ideas out there until one sounds viable[^1]
>2. _The Work Backwards Approach_ - start with an idea currently or potentially worth a lot of money and work backwards[^2]

Personally, I believe the best ideas come from your own genuine problems. That may sound like common knowledge at this point but, unfortunately, it is too frequently ignored and absolutely worth repeating. There are lots of reasons for this, but I'll give you the two most important: 1) if you have that problem, someone else likely does too and 2) you'll be your own customer. The first point should help give you an indication of market size and the second point should help you classify its level of importance - two of the main pieces of information you should consider if you are going to quit your job and start a company around your idea.

Okay, so you have an idea that came from a genuine problem. Is the market sizable[^3]? _Check_. Is finding a solution important? _Check_.

_Now what?_

Look at how the world currently views the problem. Is your idea just an iteration on the current solution? Are you still viewing the problem the same way that everyone else views it?

The best ideas have a contrarian view of the problem. It's not simply a matter of leveraging the newest technology to solve the problem differently. To be contrarian, you have to invert the problem and attack it from a different angle (i.e. if everyone looks at it from the top down, try solving it from the bottom up, etc.).

[^1]: What's wrong with the _Shotgun_ approach: the ideas may not be your genuine problem or even a problem, you might not have the domain expertise to solve the problem, you may not be a customer, the market might not be large enough to warrant a solution, the current solution may be good enough, etc.
[^2]: What's wrong with the _Work Backwards_ approach:
[^3]: Market size isn't everything. Owning 90% of a niche market can be just as important as owning 0.01% of a massive market. Knowing the competitive landscape and realizing where you fit in is more important.

I'm not saying that you can't succeed, but starting a company is hard and based on my own experience if you aren't close to the problem and personally invested in the solution that you are working on, the the tough days are going to be hard to get through.

I often hear students talk about their prospective careers. But when I press them about their career goals, most of them don't start until after they have started their first job.

If any of you are like me, the first thing that comes to mind when you hear the word "apprentice", might be blacksmiths. As antiquated at that thought may be, the idea of apprenticeships is still very much alive today.

Even many jobs for those coming out of college mimic the apprenticeship framework. First, many graduates are expected to take an "entry-level" job at an "entry-level" salary. Then those new hires usually spend the first couple years on-the-job learning the industry, the company, and the work before they are finally entrusted to contribute with the skills they have acquired under their company's tutelage.

Sound familiar?

This is definitely not true for every company and it is actually not even the point of this article. The point is that the idea of apprenticeship, that a graduate needs to work for company X to learn Y in order to eventually achieve Z, is so prevalent that I see far too many students put their learning in the hands of their employers rather than their own.

In essence, an apprenticeship is a position where a person works for a skilled employer to learn a trade. When I hear the word apprentice, the first thing to come to my mind is blacksmiths.

Drafts are posts without a date. They’re posts you’re still working on and don’t want to publish yet. To get up and running with drafts, check the _drafts folder in the site’s root.

To preview your site with drafts, simply run **`jekyll serve`** or **`jekyll build`** with the **`--drafts`** switch. Each will be assigned the value modification time of the draft file for its date, and thus you will see currently edited drafts as the latest posts.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll's GitHub repo][jekyll-gh].

cd directory/directory/file
git status
git add .
git commit -m "commit message here"
git push
